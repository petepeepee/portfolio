      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>This is the newest addition to my life and I couldn't be happier that I applied to study this field in Jamk. As
        said
        before I am fairly new at this game but I am eager to learn and improve my skills. My interests are in the
        fields
        of
        full-stack developer and data and ai.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is my second year at Jamk and
        I have learned Javascript/Typescript as coding languages but I believe that I am going to expand the programming
        languages. This portfolio has been done by using Angular as the framework and this is actually my final project
        for
        course teaching Angular (two birds with one stone: project for school and project for applying jobs). I also
        have
        experience in using Svelte and I have plans to learn NextJS and Tailwind CSS in the future. Some of the skills I
        have
        learned during this fall was the fundamentals and work with databases with MySQL and MongoDB.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The reason I wanted to make this portfolio and show some of my skills I've learned is that I like learning new
        things
        in this field and make myself better at coding and using different kinds of tools and I believe that work
        environment
        would be great place to challenge myself and become better. My plans for the future is to develop my skills and
        understanding. Here is a list of some the technologies I have learned:</p>
